# uk-water-security-project

This repository contains the datasets and Jupyter notebook which form an analysis of UK water insecurity events.

This project consists of multiple datasets drawn from various authorities, concerning the UK climate and economy. The main Jupyter notebook file can be downloaded and run to recreate some of the data science investigations and visuals, but you must also download the datasets so that the file can import the data. Links to the original sources can be found in the notebook.
