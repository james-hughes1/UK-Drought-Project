This well has continuously fallen, and is now very nearly dry. I have never known it before with less than 7ft. or 8 ft. of water during the middle six months of the year. The drought of the past summer has aggravated, but has not caused, the short water supply, for we have had such droughts before. It is due to the dry time from October, 1897, to April, 1898. .... There has been a great outcry about the water supply in the East-end of London, but.... there are many parts of the country which are worse off than they are.

Since that time, the weather has been drier than average and the reservoir is now less than half full. This has increasingly serious implications for water supply prospects in 1977. A ban on the use of hosepipes for watering private gardens and washing private motorcars was imposed on 1st June 1976 and appeals for economy in the use of water have been made to domestic and industrial consumers. On 16th July 1976 the Company applied for an Order authorising them to reduce the quality of compensation water required to be discharged from the reservoir and the Secretary of State for the Environment has decided to make the Order. In view of the continuing deterioration of the water situation, there is an urgent need to take further steps to conserve the stocks of water in the reservoir. Notice is hereby given that the Sunderland and South Shields Water Company has applied to the Secretary of Statef or the Environment for an Order under section 1 (3) (b) of the Drought Act 1976 authorising the Company to prohibit or limit during a period of six months the use of water within its area of supply for the following purposes: (a) the watering, by hosepipe, sprinkler or other apparatus, of parks, ornamental gardens, lawns, recreation grounds, sports grounds, playing fields, golf courses or racecourses, whether publicly or privately owned ; (b) the filling, whether wholly or partially, of privately owned swimming pools and ornamental ponds other than fish ponds ; (e) the operation of mechanical car washers, whether automatic or not; (d) the washing of road vehicles for any reason other than safety or hygiene ; (e) the cleaning of the exterior of buildings ; (/) the operation of ornamental fountains or cascades, including any where water is recycled ; (g) the operation, in relation to any building or other premises, of any cistern which flushes automatically, during any period when the premises are wholly or substantially unoccupied. A map showing the Company's area of supply may be inspected by any person at the offices of the Company, 29 John Street, Sunderland, during normal office hours.

This has resulted in stocks of water being low for the time of year. A ban on the use of hosepipes for watering private gardens and washing private cars in Wear Division was imposed on 1st June 1976 and appeals for economy in the use of •water have been made to domestic and industrial con- •sumers. On 16th July 1976 the Authority applied to the Secretary of State for the Environment for an Order authorising them to reduce for a period of 6 months the •quantity of compensation water required to be discharged from Bumhope Reservoir and Tunstall Reservoir. A similar shortage of rain in upper Teesdale and in the 'Stokesley area of Cleveland and North Yorkshire has resulted 11977 in a diminution of the flows from springs which are the source of public water supply in those areas. Accordingly the Authority is imposing a ban on the use of hosepipes in both areas from 30th August 1976. To further conserve stocks of water: Notice is hereby given that the Northumbrian Water Authority have applied to the Secretary of State for the Environment under section 1 (3) (b) of the Drought Act 1976 for an, Order to prohibit or restrict for a period of 6 months the use of water for the following purposes: (a) the watering, by hosepipe, sprinkler or other appara- tus, of parks, ornamental gardens, lawns, recreation grounds, sports grounds, playing fields, golf courses or racecourses, whether publicly or privately owned ; (b) the filling, whether wholly or partially, of privately owned swimming pools and ornamental pools other than fish ponds ; (c) the operation of mechanical car washers, whether automatic or not; (d) the washing of road vehicles for any reason other than safety or hygiene ; (e) the cleaning of the exterior of buildings ; (/) the operation of ornamental fountains or cascades, including any where water is recycled ; (g) the operation, in relation to any building or other premises, of any cistern which flushes automatically, during any period when the premises are wholly or substantially unoccupied.

Since that time, the weather has been drier than average and the reservoir is now less than half full. This has increasingly serious implications for water supply prospects in 1977. A ban on the use of hosepipes for watering private gardens and washing private motorcars was imposed on 1st June 1976 and appeals for economy in the use of water have been made to domestic and industrial consumers.

Notice is hereby given that in order to ensure maintenance of essential supplies of water to its consumers this summer the Company is applying to the Secretary of State for the Environment for an Order pursuant to Sections l(3)(e) of the Drought Act 1976 to modify conditions relating to the abstraction of water from the Chalk Strata at Boughton, Wineycock Shaw, Howfield, Thanington, Godmersham, Chilham and Hoplands Farm Pumping Stations and from the Lower Greensand Strata at Borough Green (including Nepicar Lane) and Charing Pumping Stations. The modifications would provide for temporary increases in the existing authorised maximum day abstraction quantities which would also necessitate a temporary increase in the authorised annual quantities in certain cases. The proposed modifications would also involve the temporary suspension of the compensation water provisions for the Chilham and Godmersham licences and the temporary suspension of the restricted abstraction conditions for the Howfield and Thanington licences with respect to the 104.6 Ml/d (23 m.g.d.) flow conditions in the River Great Stour as measured at the Horton Gauging Station.

In view of the exceptional shortage of rainfall throughout 1989-1991, a considerable reduction in recharge to all aquifers has occurred threatening a serious deficiency of supplies of water in the statutory area of Mid Kent Water pic in 1991. Notice is hereby given that in order to ensure the maintenance of essential supplies of water to its customers this summer, the Company is applying to the Secretary of State for the Environment for an Order pursuant to sections 131(4)(a) and (0 of the Water Act 1989, to modify licence conditions relating to the abstraction of water from the Chalk Strata, at Boughton, Wineycock Shaw, Howfield, Thanington, Gpdmersham, Chilham, Hoplands Farm and Stockbury Pumping Stations. The modifications would provide for temporary increases in the existing authorised maximum day abstraction quantities which would also necessitate a temporary increase in the authorised annual quantity in certain cases. The proposed modifications would also involve the temporary suspension of the compensation water provisions for the Chilham and Godmersham licences and the temporary suspension of the compensation restricted abstraction conditions for the Howfield and Thanington licences with respect to the 104.6 Mid.

The affected area includes all of the following Local Authority areas insofar as they receive a supply of water from the Company: All London Boroughs (except for Hillingdon, Harrow, Barking & Dagenham and Havering), together with the Borough (or District) Councils of Broxbourne, Dartford, East Hertfordshire, Elmbridge, Epping Forest, Epsom and Ewell, Sevenoaks and Spelthorne. The proposed Drought Order will allow the Company to prohibit or limit the use of water which has been supplied by the Company within the affected area for any of the following purposes: (a) the watering by hosepipe, sprinkler or other similar apparatus, of: (i) gardens (other than market gardens), including lawns, verges and other landscaped areas; (ii) allotments; (iii) parks; or (iv) any natural or artificial surfaces used for sport or recreation, whether publicly or privately owned; (b) the filling (whether wholly or partially) of privately owned swimming pools other than: (i) pools designed to be used in the course of a programme of medical treatment; (ii) the filling of pools where necessary in the course of their construction; (c) the filling (whether wholly or partially) of ornamental pools other than fish ponds; (d) the operation of mechanical vehicle washers, whether automatic or not; (e) the washing of road vehicles, boats, railway rolling stock or aircraft for any reason other than safety or hygiene; (f) the cleaning of the exterior of buildings other than windows; (g) the cleaning of windows by hosepipe, sprinkler or other similar apparatus; (h) the cleaning of industrial premises or plant for any reason other than safety or hygiene; (i) the operation of ornamental fountains or cascades, including those where water is recycled; (j) the operation, in relation to any building or other premises, of any cistern which flushes automatically, during any period when the premises are wholly or substantially unoccupied.
